# Learning Go

## Chapter 2. Primitive Types and Declarations

### Built-in types

Go has many of the same built-in types as other languages: booleans, integers, floats, and strings.
Using these types idiomatically is sometimes a challenge for developers who are transitioning from another language.
We are going to look at these types and see how they work best in Go.
Before we review the types, let's cover some of the concepts that apply to all types.

#### The zero value

Go, like most modern languages, assigns a default *zero value* to any variable that is declared but not assigned a value.
Having an explicit zero value makes code clearer and removes a source of bugs found in C and C++ programs.
As we talk about each type, we will also cover the zero value for the type.

#### Literals

In order to make it easier to read longer integer literals, Go allows you to put underscores in the middle of your literal.

*Rune literals* represent characters and are surrounded by single quotes.
Unlike many languages, single quotes and double quotes are not interchangeable.

#### Booleans

The `bool` type represents Boolean variables.
Variables of bool type can have one of two values: `true` or `false`.
The zero value for a `bool` is `false`.
```go
var flag bool // no value assigned, set to false
var isAwesome = true
```

#### A Taste of Strings and Runes

#### `var` vs `:=`

For a small language, Go has a lot of ways to declare variables.
There's a reason for this; each declaration style communicates something about how the variable is used.
Let's go through the ways you can declare a variable in Go, and see when each is appropriate.

#### Unused variables

#### Naming variables and constants

Even though underscore is a valid character in a variable name, it is rarely used, because idiomatic Go doesn't use snake case (names like `index_counter` or `number_tries`).
Instead, Go uses camel case (names like `indexCounter` or `numberTries`) when an identifier name consists of multiple words.

Within a function, favor short variable names.
The smaller the scope for a variable, the shorter the name that's used for it.
It is very common in Go to see single letter variable names.

## Chapter 3. Composite Types

### Arrays

### Slices

Most of the time, when you want a data structure that holds a sequence of values, a slice is what you should use.
What makes slices so useful is that the length is *not* part of the type for a slice.
This removes the limitations of arrays.

Working with slices looks quite a bit like working with arrays, but there are subtle differences.
The first thing to notice is that we donâ€™t specify the size of the slice when we declare it:
```go
var x = []int{10, 20, 30}
```
This creates a slice of 3 `int`s using a *slice literal*.
Just like arrays, we can also specify only the indices with values in the slice literal:
```go
var x = []int{1, 5: 4, 6, 10: 100, 15}
```
You read and write slices using bracket syntax, and just like arrays, you can't read or write past the end or use a negative index:
```go
x[0] = 0
fmt.Println(x[2])
```
So far, slices have seemed identical to arrays.
We start to see the differences between arrays and slices when we look at declaring slices without using a literal.
```go
var x []int
```
This creates a slice of `int`s.
Since no value is assigned, `x` is assigned to the zero value for a slice, which is something we haven't seen before: `nil`.
In Go, `nil` is an identifier that represents the lack of a value for some types.
Like the untyped numeric constants we saw in the previous chapter, `nil` has no type, so it can be assigned or compared against values of different types.
A `nil` slice contains nothing.

#### `len`

#### `append`

The built-in `append` function is used to grow slices:
```go
var x []int
x = append(x, 10)
```
The append function takes at least two parameters, a slice of any type and a value of that type.
It returns a slice of the same type.
The returned slice is assigned back to the slice that's passed in.

#### Capacity

#### `make`

### Strings and Runes and Bytes

### Maps

Like most languages, Go provides a built-in data type for situations where you want to associate one value to another.
The map type is written as `map[keyType]valueType`.
Let's take a look at a few different ways to declare maps.
First, you can use a `var` declaration to create a map variable that's set to its zero value:
```go
var nilMap map[string]int
```
In this case `nilMap` is declared to be a map with `string` keys and `int` values.
The zero value for a map is `nil`.
A `nil` map has a length of 0.
Attempting to read a `nil` map always returns the zero value for the map's value type.
However, attempting to write to a `nil` map variable causes a panic.

We can use a `:=` declaration to create a map variable by assigning it a *map literal*:
```go
totalWins := map[string]int{}
```
In this case, we are using an empty map literal.

The key for a map can be any comparable type.
This means you cannot use a slice or a map as the key for a map.

#### Reading and Writing a Map

#### The comma ok idiom

However, you sometimes do need to find out if a key is in a map.
Go provides the *comma ok idiom* to tell the difference between a key that's associated with a zero value and a key that's not in the map.
```go
m := map[string]int {
    "hello": 5,
    "world": 0,
}
v, ok := m["hello"]
fmt.Println(v, ok)

v, ok := m["world"]
fmt.Println(v, ok)

v, ok := m["goodbye"]
fmt.Println(v, ok)
```
Rather than assign the result of a map read to a single variable, with the comma ok idiom you assign the results of a map read to two variables.
The first gets the value associated with the key.
The second value returned is a bool.
It is usually named `ok`.
If `ok` is `true`, the key is present in the map.
If `ok` is `false`, the key is not present.

#### Deleting From Maps

Key-value pairs are removed from a map via the built-in `delete` function:
```go
m := map[string]int {
    "hello": 5,
    "world": 0,
}
delete(m, "hello")
```
The `delete` function takes a map and a key and then removes the key-value pair with the specified key.
If the key isn't present in the map or if the map is `nil`, nothing happens.
The `delete` function doesn't return a value.

### Structs

When you have related data that you want to group together, you should define a *struct*.
Most languages have a concept that's similar to a struct and the syntax that Go uses to read and write structs should look familiar.
```go
type person struct {
    name string
    age int
    pet string
}
```
A struct type is defined with the keyword `type`, the name of the struct type, the keyword `struct`, and a pair of braces (`{}`).
Within the braces, you list the fields in the struct.
Just like we put the variable name first and the variable type second in a `var` declaration, we put the struct field name first and the struct field type second.
Also note that unlike map literals, there are no commas separating the fields in a struct declaration.
You can define a struct type inside or outside of a function.
A struct type that's defined within a function can only be used within the function.

Once a struct type is declared, we can define variables of that type.
```go
var fred person
```
Here we are using a `var` declaration.
Since no value is assigned to `fred`, it gets the zero value for the `person` struct type.
A zero value struct has every field set to the field's zero value.

A *struct literal* can be assigned to a variable as well.
```go
bob := person{}
```
Unlike maps, there is no difference between assigning an empty struct literal and not assigning a value at all.
Both initialize all of the fields in the struct to the fields' zero values.
There are two different styles for a non-empty struct literal.
A struct literal can be specified as a comma-separated list of values for the fields inside of braces:

A field in a struct is accessed with dotted notation:
```go
bob.name = "Bob"
fmt.Println(bob.name)
```

#### Anonymous Structs

## Chapter 4. Blocks, Shadows, and Control Structures

### Blocks

Each place where a declaration occurs is called a *block*.
Variables, constants, types and functions declared outside of any functions are placed in the *package* block.
We've used import statements in our programs to gain access to printing and math functions.
They define names for other packages that are valid for the file that contains the `import` statement.
These names are in the *file* block.
All of the variables defined at the top level of a function (including the parameters to a function) are in a block.
Within a function, every set of braces (`{}`) defines another block, and in a bit we will see that the control structures in Go define blocks of their own.

You can access an identifier defined in any outer block from within any inner block.
This raises the question: what happens when you have a declaration with the same name as an identifier in a containing block?
If you do that, you *shadow* the identifier created in the outer block.

## Chapter 5. Functions

### Declaring and Calling Functions

We've already seen functions being declared and used.
Every program we've written has a `main` function that's the starting point for every Go program, and we've been calling the `fmt.Println` function to display output to the screen.

### Simulating Named and Optional Parameters

Before we get to the unique function features that Go has, let's mention two that Go *doesn't* have: named and optional input parameters.
If you want to emulate named and optional parameters, define a struct that has fields that match the desired parameters, and pass the struct to your function.
Here's a snippet of code that demonstrates this pattern:
```go
type MyFuncOpts struct {
    FirstName string
    LastName string
    Age int
}

func MyFunc(opts MyFuncOpts) error {
    // do something here
}

func main() {
    MyFunc(MyFuncOpts {
        LastName: "Patel",
        Age: 50,
    })
    MyFunc(MyFuncOpts {
        FirstName: "Joe",
        LastName: "Smith",
    })
}
```

### Variadic Input Parameters and Slices

Like many languages, Go supports *variadic parameters*.
The variadic parameter must be the last (or only) parameter in the input parameter list.
You indicate it with three dots (`...`) before the type.
The variable that's created within the function is a slice of the specified type.
You use it just like any other slice.

### Multiple Return Values

The first difference that we'll see between Go and other languages is that Go allows for multiple return values.

## Chapter 6. Pointers

### A Quick Pointer Primer

A pointer is simply a variable that holds the location in memory where a value is stored.

Every variable is stored in one or more contiguous memory locations, called *addresses*.
Different types of variables can take up different amounts of memory.

A pointer is simply a variable whose contents are the address where another variable is stored.

While different types of variables can take up different numbers of memory locations, every pointer, no matter what type it is pointing to, is always the same size: a number that holds the location in memory where the data is stored.

The zero value for a pointer is `nil`.

Go's pointer syntax is partially borrowed from C and C++.
Since Go has a garbage collector, most of the pain of memory management is removed.
Furthermore, some of the tricks that you can do with pointers in C and C++, including *pointer arithmetic* are not allowed in Go.

The built-in function `new` creates a pointer variable.
It returns a pointer to a zero-value instance of the provided type.
```go
var x = new(int)
fmt.Println(x == nil)
fmt.Println(*x)
```

### Don't Fear The Pointers

The difference between Go and these languages is that Go gives you the *choice* to use pointers or values for both primitives and structs.
Most of the time, you should use a value.
They make it easier to understand how and when your data is modified.
A secondary benefit is that using values reduces the amount of work that the garbage collector has to do.

### Pointers Indicate Mutable Parameters

However, if a pointer is passed to a function, the function gets a copy of the pointer.
This still points to the original data, which means that the original data can be modified by the called function.

## Chapter 7. Types, Methods, and Interfaces

As we saw in earlier chapters, Go is a statically typed language with both built-in types and user-defined types.
Like most modern languages, Go allows you to attach methods to types.
It also has type abstraction, allowing you to write code that invokes methods without explicitly specifying the implementation.

However, Go's approach to methods, interfaces, and types is very different from most other languages in common use today.
Go is designed to encourage the best practices that are advocated by software engineers, avoiding inheritance while encouraging composition.
In this chapter, we'll take a look at types, methods, and interfaces, and see how to use them to build testable and maintainable programs.

### Types in Go

In addition to struct literals, you can use any primitive type or compound type literal to define a concrete type.
Here are a few examples:
```go
type Score int
type Converter func(string)Score
type TeamScores map[string]Score
```

### Methods

Like most modern languages, Go supports methods on user-defined types.

The methods for a type are defined at the package block level:
```go
type Person struct {
    FirstName string
    LastName string
    Age int
}

func (p Person) String() string {
    return fmt.Sprintf("%s %s, age %d", p.FirstName, p.LastName, p.Age)
}
```
Method declarations look just like function declarations, with one addition: the *receiver* specification.
The receiver appears between the keyword `func` and the name of the method.
Just like all other variable declarations, the receiver name appears before the type.
By convention, the receiver name is a short abbreviation of the type's name, usually its first letter.
It is non-idiomatic to use `this` or `self`.

Just like functions, method names cannot be overloaded.
You can use the same method names for different types, but you can't use the same method name for two different methods on the same type.
While this philosophy feels limiting when coming from languages that have method overloading, not reusing names is part of Go's philosophy of making clear what your code is doing.

We'll talk more about packages in Chapter 9, but be aware that methods must be declared in the same package as their associated type; Go doesn't allow you to add methods to types you don't control.
While you can define a method in a different file within the same package as the type declaration, it is best to keep your type definition and its associated methods together so that it's easy to follow the implementation.

#### Code Your Methods for `nil` Instances

#### Methods Are Functions Too

#### Functions Versus Methods

#### Type Declarations Aren't Inheritance

#### Types Are Executable Documentation

#### `iota` Is for Enumerations - Sometimes

### Use Embedding for Composition

While Go doesn't have inheritance, it encourages code reuse via built-in support for composition and promotion:
```go
type Employee struct {
    Name string
    ID string
}

func (e Employee) Description() string {
    return fmt.Sprintf("%s (%s)", e.Name, e.ID)
}

type Manager struct {
    Employee
    Reports []Employee
}

func (m Manager) FindNewEmployees() []Employee {
    // do business logic
}
```
Note that `Manager` contains a field of type `Employee`, but no name is assigned to that field.
This makes `Employee` an *embedded field*.
Any fields or methods declared on an embedded field are *promoted* to the containing struct and can be invoked directly on it.
That makes the following code valid:
```go
m := Manager{
    Employee: Employee{
        Name:         "Bob Bobson",
        ID:             "12345",
    },
    Reports: []Employee{},
}
fmt.Println(m.ID)            // prints 12345
fmt.Println(m.Description()) // prints Bob Bobson (12345)
```

### Embedding Is Not Inheritance

Built-in embedding support is rare in programming languages (I'm not aware of another popular language that supports it).
Many developers who are familiar with inheritance (which is available in many languages) try to understand embedding by treating it as inheritance.
That way lies tears.
You cannot assign a variable of type Manager to a variable of type Employee.
If you want to access the Employee field in Manager, you must do so explicitly.

### A Quick Lesson on Interfaces

While Go's concurrency model (which we cover in Chapter 10) gets all of the publicity, the real star of Go's design is its implicit interfaces, the only abstract type in Go.
Let's see what makes them so great.

In an interface declaration, an interface literal appears after the name of the interface type.
It lists the methods that must be implemented by a concrete type to meet the interface.
The methods defined by an interface are called the method set of the interface.

Interfaces are usually named with "er" endings.

### Interfaces are Type-Safe Duck Typing
